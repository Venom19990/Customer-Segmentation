# CASE STUDY / PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
  A Business owner owns a Mall and wants to increase his Sales in order to generate profitable Revenue for there store's respected Products.
  APPROACH :
    We will use the information / Data of the Customers from the Mall's Database In order to design Marketing Strategies to increase Sales.
    
# Life-Cycle Of The Project :
   
    Data Collection / Gathering.
    Data Pre-processing.
    Model Selection. 
    Selection of Parameters / Variables.
    Training the Model.
    Visualisation of the Model.
  
# Algorithm Used :
    Clustering Algorithm -: K-Means Algorithm.
    The Case Study Statement is an ideal example of clustering problem in which we can form groups/clusters of the customers based on the parameters for which 
    the model is designed.
    
# Libraries Includes :
    Numpy,
    Pandas,
    MatplotLib and Sea-Born (sns) for Visualisation,
    Scikit-Learn
    K-means()
    
# Working :
    We decided to visualise this Model on the Parameters such as 'Annual Income' and 'Spending score' of the Customers 
    to form different Clusters.
    
    How to find the Ideal Number of Clusters?
  Solution : By using the Elbow-Point-Graph Method, as we observe the Graph carefully we can see that there is no sudden drop in the line from the number of cluster 
  range 4 to 6, We observe a linear decline. So, we took a business decision of having 5 clusters for our Visualisation.
